                            You can also specify the alignment of the label, rotation, etc.
                            If the label is bigger than the barcode itself, the image will get bigger to avoid text clipping.
                            Add the setRatio method for I25 barcodes

                            But you can set it to 300 if you wish to print it.
                            You do not need an additional DLL for this.

                            You can now specify a specific table for Code 128. For instance, if you want to force to use the table B, you would write the following to parse
                            array(CODE128_B, 'The Text To Encode')
                            The default table selection for Code 128 is automatically chosen.
                            Fix many PHP4 errors.

v2.0.0      23 apr 2008     The new version has been released... All the codes have been revamped to fit with
                            common file for 2D barcodes. Instead of using "setText()" method, the method
                            parse() is used.
                            Thickness is modified by the scale.
                            Code 128: it has been modified completely, no need to specify which encoding you want to
                            use, it will select it for you automatically and try to get the shortest barcode.
                            Codabar: you can't only put one letter as a barcode.
                            Code 93: supports now the extended full ASCII 0 to 127
                            Code 39 extended has been added in a separate file since the extended
                            version of Code 39 is totally optional.
                            Codabar has been fixed for B and C letter
                            We got our real nice domain: http://www.barcodephp.com
v1.3.0      13 apr 2007     Remove ISBN from EAN-13 and a new file has been created to handle
                            ISBN-10 and ISBN-13.
v1.2.4      1  feb 2007     Fix Code128. There were some errors dealing with C table
v1.2.3pl1   11 mar 2006     Correct the EAN-13/ISBN file. There was a problem with displaying correctly an ISBN.
v1.2.3      8  feb 2006     Int for font is no longer deprecated and can be used.
                            Correct many labels' positions : ean8, ean13, upca, upce
                            Correct getWidth of Font.
v1.2.3b     5  jan 2006     Add separate checksum method to calculate and get this special number created and a way to display it with the label.
                            Correct code for PHP5.1 compatibility. Selecting a char by { } is now deprecated. Using of [ ] is used instead.
                            Correct checksum for Code11. In some case, the checksum was bad.
                            Correct problem displaying label with text under the baseline (letters such as p, g...).
                            SIZE_SPACING_FONT_END has been suppressed since the previous bug has been fixed.
                            Correct label if two barcode were generated with the same font. The font is now cloned immediately before using.
                            The FDrawing has new methods now, use setBarcode and draw instead of add_barcode and draw_all. Only one barcode per FDrawing is possible now.
                            Correct errors of othercode if no text font has been selected.
                            othercode was not working for PHP4 due to the lack of the str_split function. Now the function is emulated.
                            New file : JoinDraw allows you to join 2 graphic and align each of them. (Useful for UCPExt). PHP5 only
                            Currently Working on UPC-A label
v1.2.2      23 jul 2005     Correct checksum for i25 and s25 barcode (thanks to Gerald Pienkowski (Germany))

                            Use PHP fonts is deprecated and they will be deleted in further versions.
                            Remove the "alt" text on the image (IE displays it as a tooltip)
                            Color class has been enhanced and accept new parameter for constructor
                            Now you don't have to provide a specific size of the image, it will be calculated automatically for barcodes and errors
                            Added the version number at the bottom of the script html.
                            Correcting code 128 to output code correctly when passing from code C to another code

                            Because to many people are writing to me that saying the script doesn't work (because they have PHP4).
v1.01       7  jul 2004     Correcting code39.barcode.php
